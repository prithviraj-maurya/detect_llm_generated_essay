## INTRODUCTION

The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational
settings has ushered in a new era of possibilities and
challenges<sup>\[3\]</sup>. While these advanced language models offer
unprecedented opportunities for students to enhance their writing skills
and access a wealth of information, concerns have arisen regarding their
potential impact on academic integrity, particularly in the realm of
essay writing. With the ability to produce text virtually
indistinguishable from human writing, LLMs pose a significant challenge
to educators in preserving the authenticity of students’ work and
preventing plagiarism.

This research project delves into the evolving landscape of education,
where technological advancements, particularly in natural language
processing, have given rise to both excitement and apprehension. The
focus of this study lies in the development of a machine-learning model
that can effectively discern essays generated by LLMs from those
composed by middle and high school students. The ultimate goal is to
provide educators with a reliable tool to uphold academic integrity
while acknowledging the ethical use of LLMs as educational aids.

In this context, it is crucial to recognize that LLMs can be powerful
allies in the learning process when used responsibly. As tools that can
assist students in refining their writing skills, deepening their
understanding of various subjects, and fostering creativity, LLMs offer
valuable contributions to education. However, striking a balance between
harnessing these benefits and safeguarding against potential misuse is
imperative for educators and institutions.

Recent works in this area have laid the foundation for understanding and
addressing challenges related to AI-generated text in educational
contexts. For instance, Zellers et al. \[2\] proposed methodologies for
defending against neural fake news, acknowledging the growing concerns
associated with the generation of misleading content using advanced

As LLMs become more accessible and pervasive, the need for effective
mechanisms to identify machine-generated content becomes paramount.
Striking a delicate balance between fostering responsible use of LLMs
for educational purposes and preventing misuse is essential to ensuring
the continued trustworthiness of academic assessments.

It is crucial to emphasize that while concerns about the potential
misuse of LLMs are valid, these models can also potentially
revolutionize education positively. Responsible integration of LLMs can
enhance the learning experience, offering students valuable resources
for research, critical thinking, and creative expression. Through this
research endeavor, we aspire to contribute insights that foster a
nuanced understanding of the intersection between advanced language
models and academic integrity, ultimately providing educators with the
tools to navigate this complex terrain effectively.

##  METHODS 

### Data

To ensure the robustness and generalizability of our model, we have
assembled a diverse and extensive dataset of essays sourced from
Kaggle<sup>\[1\]</sup>. This dataset encompasses essays from both middle
and high school students, as well as essays generated by various large
language models (LLMs), including GPT-3<sup>\[12\]</sup> and
BERT<sup>\[11\]</sup>. The inclusion of human-written and
machine-generated essays is instrumental in creating a well-balanced
dataset that accurately represents a spectrum of writing styles and
qualities, crucial for achieving accurate detection.

The dataset categorizes the text into two main classes: "AI-generated"
and "Human-written," denoted by the binary label "1" and "0"
respectively. Human-authored essays were collected by providing students
with specific prompts. The AI-generated essays, produced by LLMs like
ChatGPT<sup>\[12\]</sup> using their APIs, have been labeled accordingly
as "1." The problem is formulated as a classification task, where the
goal is to predict whether an essay is written by a human (0) or
generated by an AI model (1). Kaggle has collected over **10,000**
student essays and the same prompts were used to generate these essays
by LLMs such as ChatGPT using their APIs. Using the same prompts we
generated more such examples from different LLMs such as BERT and GPT
adding 2000 essays to the dataset.

The dataset is accessible through the Kaggle API, requiring
authentication with a Kaggle account and adherence to the platform’s
terms and conditions. The data files are available in the CSV (Comma
Separated Values) format and can be read by libraries such as "Pandas"
in the Python environment. It comprises four columns:

**ID**: A unique identifier for each text entry.

**Prompt**: The prompt (question) that was provided to the students to
write the essay, same was used to ask an LLM to generate an essay.

**Text**: The essay content, whether human-authored or AI-generated.

**Generated**: A binary label indicating whether the essay is
AI-generated (1) or human-written (0).

| **Id**   | **Prompt**                                                                                       | **Text**                                                                                                                                                                          | **Generated** |

### Methodology

In our model evaluations, we selected the ROC AUC score<sup>\[5\]</sup>
as the key metric. This score, spanning from 0 to 1, serves as a robust
indicator of the model’s performance on the data. Moreover, it addresses
the trade-off between bias and variance in the model.

1\. *Baseline Model*:

To establish a baseline for our essay detection task, we initiated a
straightforward Bag of Words<sup>\[6\]</sup> encoding coupled with a
logistic regression<sup>\[8\]</sup> classifier. To explore alternative
tokenization methods, we experimented with TF-IDF<sup>\[7\]</sup>
vectorization, which, although not significantly outperforming the Bag
of Words model, added a nuanced perspective to our analysis. In pursuit
of a more complex model, we incorporated the XGBoost<sup>\[9\]</sup>
model from the XGBoost Classifier library. To leverage the complementary
strengths of different models, we implemented an ensemble combining
logistic regression and XGBoost.

2\. *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)*:

Delving into deep learning, we constructed a custom model featuring a
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)<sup>\[10\]</sup> layer
followed by a Dense layer. Notably, during experimentation, we observed
that the model’s performance peaked with 5 epochs, suggesting a
potential issue of overfitting with more prolonged training. The plot
below illustrates the accuracy and loss function for each epoch of
training:

3\. *Transformers*:

Transitioning to transformer models, we explored the application of the
pre-trained Distilled BERT Uncased transformer<sup>\[11\]</sup>.
Leveraging pre-trained embeddings from BERT, we fine-tuned the
transformer model on our dataset. This exploration of transformer models
provides valuable insights into the efficacy of leveraging
state-of-the-art language models for the specific task of distinguishing
between human-authored and LLM-generated essays.

These varied approaches encompass both traditional machine learning and
cutting-edge deep learning techniques, allowing us to comprehensively
assess the strengths and limitations of different models in addressing
the unique challenges posed by LLM-generated content detection in the
context of academic writing.

### Limitations

1\. Representation Bias in External Data:

The inclusion of external data from different AI models introduces
potential biases specific to those models, limiting the generalizability
of our findings.

2\. Sensitivity to Model Choices:

The sensitivity of our models to tokenization and embedding methods may
impact their generalization to diverse datasets or domains.

3\. Challenges in Deep Learning Generalization:

The Bidirectional LSTM model exhibited potential overfitting,
highlighting the delicate balance required in deep-learning models for
optimal generalization.

These limitations underscore the need for cautious interpretation and
further refinement of models for robust essay detection in diverse
educational contexts.

### Analysis

Our analysis encompasses a multifaceted exploration of different models
applied to the task of distinguishing between essays generated by large
language models (LLMs) and those authored by middle and high school
students. We conducted an in-depth investigation, utilizing various
machine learning and deep learning techniques to achieve a better
understanding of the strengths and limitations of each approach.

1\. Baseline Model:

The baseline model, employing a Bag of Words encoding with logistic
regression, provided a solid foundation for comparison. This initial
model yielded a ROC AUC score of *0.78*. The subsequent exploration of
TF-IDF<sup>\[7\]</sup> vectorization demonstrated the versatility of
tokenization methods but did not yield a substantial improvement. The
incorporation of the XGBoost<sup>\[9\]</sup> model introduced a notable
performance boost, emphasizing the effectiveness of gradient-boosting
techniques. The ensemble combining logistic regression<sup>\[8\]</sup>
and XGBoost, showcased the potential synergy of different models,
resulting in an enhanced ROC AUC score of *0.818*.

2\. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):

Our foray into deep learning involved the development of a custom model
featuring a Bidirectional LSTM layer. The training process, monitored
over epochs, revealed a phenomenon of diminishing returns after 5
epochs, suggesting a delicate balance between model complexity and
overfitting. The training plot illustrated fluctuations in accuracy and
loss, guiding our decision to optimize the model with a limited number
of epochs.

3\. Transformers:

Exploring transformer models, we adopted the pre-trained Distilled
BERT<sup>\[11\]</sup> Uncased transformer and fine-tuned it on our
dataset. Despite the inherent complexity of transformer architectures,
the performance achieved a score of *0.775*. This finding underscores
the potential of leveraging state-of-the-art language models for the
task at hand, although further optimization and experimentation may be
required to maximize performance.

Our analysis reveals a vast difference between traditional machine
learning models and cutting-edge deep learning architectures. The
baseline models provide a solid reference point, while the more complex
models showcase the potential for significant performance gains. The
delicate balance between model complexity and overfitting, highlighted
in the RNN analysis, emphasizes the importance of careful model
selection and tuning. Additionally, the transformer model’s performance
indicates the evolving landscape of natural language processing, where
pre-trained models offer a robust foundation for specific tasks.

In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights
into the different models for detecting LLM-generated essays. Each
approach contributes unique perspectives, guiding future research
directions and offering practical considerations for educators seeking
robust tools to ensure academic integrity in the digital age.
